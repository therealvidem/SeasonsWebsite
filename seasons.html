        There are four discrete Earth seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn (or Fall), and Winter. Each season has a unique climate, and the reason for this is the Earth's tilt; the Earth is tilted at 23.5 degrees, and so when the Earth orbits around the Sun (which is not a even circle, but rather an odd ellipse). You'd think the seasons would occur because the Earth is close to the Sun during certain times (as shown in the diagram), but this is not necessarily the case.

        In the diagram, notice that during January, the Northern Hemisphere (the top half of Earth) is facing <em>away</em> from the Sun, which means the Northern Hemisphere would be cold. On the other hand, during January, the Southern Hemisphere is facing directly at the Sun, so it would be Summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Basically, at one time, the Northern and Southern Hemisphere have opposite seasons.

          <td>Spring is usually the time of growth and rebirth (after the harsh weather of Winter). Many flowers and plants bloom during this time, and the season itself is usually associated with rain (e.g. the phrase "April showers bring forth May flowers). This is a transitional season, as it transitions Winter to Summer.</td>
          <td>Summer is that time of year where most people get out of school. Since the Sun directly faces a portion of the Earth at this time, the weather is normally hotter than the rest of the seasons.</td>
          <td>Autumn (Fall) is traditionally associated with harvest, as the plants are mostly ripe. Like Spring, this is a transitional season; the days become shorter as the Sun starts facing away from the Earth.</td>
          <td>Winter is the coldest season, contrasting the hot Summer weather. Snow, which is just frozen crystalline water, typically forms and falls in place of rain. During this season, many animals begin habiting (and most animals begin migrating even before Winter).</td>
